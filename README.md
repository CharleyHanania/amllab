* [Lab 4 - Model training and experiment logging](4_Model_Training_and_Experiment_Logging.ipynb)
* [Lab 5 - Automated ML on Remote Compute](5_AutoML_Remote_Compute.ipynb)
* [Lab 6 - Model deployment](6_Deploy.ipynb)
* [Lab 7 - Responsible ML with Fairlearn](fairlearn/7_Responsible_ML_with_Fairlearn.ipynb)


At the end of the lab, please make sure you follow the instructions for [cleaning up your environment](Clean_up.pdf). This will make sure you will not incurr any further charges after the lab.
