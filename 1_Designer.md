# Lab 1 - Azure ML Designer

In this lab, you will use Azure ML's visual interface called “Designer” to train your first machine learning model of the day. 

As this lab will not require the use of any python code - or any other code for that matter - you can work through this lab following the detailed instructions provided under the following link. You can skip the first part which would provision an Azure ML service since you have already done that in the previous lab:

## Note

Please do not delete any of the assets that you create in the process. We will do this at the end of the day as you will continue using some of the assets in later labs.

Also, please only walk through part 1 **Train regression model** and not part 2 **Deploy regression model**. We have a dedicated lab on deployment to follow later today.

## Next Steps

Once you have completed the tutorial on how to use the visual interface, please open the document for lab #2.
